General rey is looking confused. After taking several critical damage he is just paying the prce of taking the opponent lightly. you want to finish it quickly as reinforcement might come at any time.
you decide to use your remaining power in one killing thrust.  After dodging several times you managed to land the killing blow through his heart. he is dead. the glory is yours.
