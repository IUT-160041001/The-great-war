			Archer
After the first battle you are stationed for the up-coming battle against the Clover army. It’s about the Reiguard Castle. 
It’s strategically the most important castle of Clover that lies between two mountains, it’s almost impossible to conquer.
The reason the best archers are gathered in this because of the rumor of new invention in marksman ship being achieved by an ally of the Clover empire.
As the battle starts, you are assigned to go to one of the hills and capture the enemy camp. As the winter approaches the night gets colder , staying the night in the hill slops outside is quite difficult . 
As you are in the enemy territory your soldiers want to raid the nearby village . They are badly in need of food,shelter.
