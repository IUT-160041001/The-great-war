The crowd was louder than ever. The arena was packed this year, and it was difficult to sneak in. 
Luckily you and Varys, who you consider to be your best friend, knew about the slightly cracked wall that had a hole just big enough for the two of you to crawl through.
You were able to make it to the middle section of the arena. 
Trying to get front row seats would be too risky, as nobles tended to have that area reserved and you may run into a guard asking to see your ticket.
The middle seats were crowded and provided anonymity.
It was also provided a decent enough view of the tournament.
The middle and top sections didn't have assigned seating; they were designed more like areas for the masses to watch.
Even though there were a few benches, most of them were old and broken. A few people had brought their own wooden stools to sit or stand on and fathers had their children on their shoulders so they could see.
You arrived just when the pre-tournament ceremonies were about to start.
Music was being played there was also dancing and horse tricks providing entertainment to the crowd.
