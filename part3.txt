In truth, winning wasn't really the point of the team battle.
Both sides were compensated well, what really mattered was if the crowd was entertained. 
It was supposed to be a disorganized brawl to get the crowd excited for the main event. 
By making it a quick fight, it resulted in some of the people being disappointed. 
Perhaps the Griffins did not know this, or didn't care. There was a brief intermission before the main event. 
Vendors walked around selling food and trinkets. 
A couple fights broke out on the top stands, which resulted in a small detachment of guards having to be sent to break it up.

Next up was your favorite knight, Sir Robert Gale. 
He was your favorite for a good reason…not only was he considered one of the best swordsmen in the realm, he had the love of the people as well; 
he often would donate his winnings to the poor or use it in outrageous ways. 
You fondly remember one tournament where Sir Robert Gale tossed a bag of gold up into the stage, causing a near riot to break out. 
He hadn't done that since. 
He also employed your father, which may be an even bigger factor of why he is your favorite knight. 
Your father worked as a stable hand for Sir Robert, taking care of his prized horse Midnight. 
Your father grew up as a farm hand, and had always taken to horses well. 
It was said that Midnight was the fastest horse in the realm, but also one of the wildest. 
Other horse trainers and stable hands refused to work with Midnight, saying he could never be broken in, but that didn't stop your father. 
He was able to get the horse under control and take care of her like no one else could. 
Sir Robert Gale took notice and hired him immediately.
